# rewinged

rewinged is a self-hosted winget package source. It's portable and can run on Linux, Windows, in Docker, locally and in any cloud.
rewinged reads your package manifests from a directory and makes them searchable and accessable to winget via a REST API.

It is currently in [pre-1.0](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4) development so command-line args, output and behavior may change at any time!

## üöÄ Features

- Directly serve [unmodified winget package manifests](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs/tree/master/manifests)
- Add your own manifests for internal or customized software
- Search, list, show and install software - the core winget features
- Package manifest versions 1.1.0, 1.2.0 and 1.4.0 are all supported simultaneously
- Runs on Windows, Linux and in [Docker](https://github.com/jantari/rewinged/blob/main/Dockerfile)

## üöß Not Yet Working or Complete

- Correlation of installed programs and programs in the repository is not perfect (in part due to [this](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli-restsource/issues/59) and [this](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli-restsource/issues/166))
- Live reload of manifests (works for new and changed manifests, but removals are only picked up on restart)
- Authentication (it's currently [not supported by winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli-restsource/issues/100))
- Probably other stuff? It's work-in-progress - please submit an issue and/or PR if you notice anything!

## üß≠ Getting Started

You can run rewinged, even without any arguments or configuration, and test the API by opening
`http://localhost:8080/information` or `http://localhost:8080/packages` in a browser or with
`curl` / `Invoke-RestMethod`.

But to use it with winget you will have to set up HTTPS because winget **requires**
REST-sources to use HTTPS - plaintext HTTP is not allowed. If you do not have a PKI
or a certificate from a publicly trusted CA like Let's Encrypt you can use then you
can generate and trust a new self-signed certificate for testing purposes:

<details>
<summary><b>Generate and trust a certificate and private key in PowerShell 5.1</b></summary>

```powershell
# Because we are adding a certificate to the local machine store, this has to be run in an elevated PowerShell session

$SelfSignedCertificateParameters = @{
    'DnsName'         = 'localhost'
    'NotAfter'        = (Get-Date).AddYears(1)
    'FriendlyName'    = 'rewinged HTTPS'
    'KeyAlgorithm'    = 'RSA'
    'KeyExportPolicy' = 'Exportable'
}
$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate @SelfSignedCertificateParameters

$RSAPrivateKey    = [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.RSACertificateExtensions]::GetRSAPrivateKey($cert)
$PrivateKeyBytes  = $RSAPrivateKey.Key.Export([System.Security.Cryptography.CngKeyBlobFormat]::Pkcs8PrivateBlob)
$PrivateKeyBase64 = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($PrivateKeyBytes, [System.Base64FormattingOptions]::InsertLineBreaks)

$CertificateBase64 = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($cert.Export('Cert'), [System.Base64FormattingOptions]::InsertLineBreaks)

Set-Content -Path private.key -Encoding Ascii -Value @"
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`r`n${PrivateKeyBase64}`r`n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
"@

Set-Content -Path cert.pem -Encoding Ascii -Value @"
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`r`n${CertificateBase64}`r`n-----END CERTIFICATE-----
"@

$store = [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Store]::new('Root', 'LocalMachine')
$store.Open('ReadWrite')
$store.Add($cert)
$store.Close()

Remove-Item $cert.PSPath
```
</details>

Then, you can run rewinged with HTTPS enabled:

```
./rewinged -https -listen localhost:8443
```

and add it as a package source in winget:

```
winget source add -n rewinged-local -a https://localhost:8443 -t "Microsoft.Rest"
```

and query it!

```
